        <blockquote>
            
*“A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except
thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality, and lives in a world of
illusions. By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull.
Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words, of reckoning and calculating.
I’m not saying that thinking is bad. Like everything else, it’s useful in
moderation. A good servant but a bad monster. And all so-called civilized
peoples have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive because, through
excessive thinking they have lost touch with reality. That’s to say, we
confuse signs, words, numbers, symbols and ideas with the real world.”*
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

*“The reason you want to be better is the reason why you aren’t, shall I
put it like that? We aren’t better because we want to be. Because the road
to hell is paved with good intentions. Because all the do-gooders in the world
whether they’re doing good for others or doing it for themselves are
troublemakers: on the basis of “kindly let me help you or you will drown,”
said the monkey putting the fish safely up a tree. Sometimes doing good to
others and even doing good to oneself is amazingly destructive because it’s
full of conceit. How do you know what’s good for other people? How do you know
what’s good for you? If you say you want to improve then you ought to know
what’s good for you, but obviously you don’t because if you did then you would
be improved. So, we don’t know. We do not really know how to interfere with
the way the world is.”*
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

*“Every intelligent individual wants to know what makes him tick, and yet is
at once fascinated and frustrated by the fact that oneself is the most
difficult of all things to know.”*
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

*“We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and emotions
are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which
we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society.”*
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

*“By being responsible, we’ve created civilization, medicine, care of the poor,
everything, but what a headache the thing has become? As we solve all our
problems, we make more problems and every problem you solved gives you ten new
problems. I’m not saying don’t do that, but don’t think you’re going to get
anywhere by doing that. That’s one way of arranging it, that’s one kind of
dance you can have, is to improve everything and have technology, but it doesn’t
really solve anything. And it’s only in a moment, you see, when you fully
understand that your situation as a human being is completely insoluable…that
there is no answer and that you give up looking for the answer — that’s PHEW —
that’s Nirvana and that’s how Buddhism works.”*
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

*“This is the real secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are
doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.”*

        <blockquote>

*“Great people self-manage. Once they know what to do, they will go figure
how to do it, they don't need to be managed. What they need is a common vision.
And that's what leadership is. What leadership is, is having a vision, being
able to articulate that so people around you can understand it and getting
consensus on a common vision. We want great people, but not seasoned
professionals. We want the people who's at the tips of their fingers and in
their passion the latest understanding of where the technology was and what we
could do with that technology and who want to bring that to lots of people.
Best managers are great individual contributors who never ever want to be a
manager but decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be
able to do as good a job as them.”*
