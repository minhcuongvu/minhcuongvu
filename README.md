  <summary>💭 👈 On philosophies and thoughts...</summary>
  </br>
  
  <details>
    <summary>—Alan Watts</summary>
    
            “A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except
            thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality, and lives in a world of 
            illusions. By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull. 
            Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words, of reckoning and calculating. 
            I’m not saying that thinking is bad. Like everything else, it’s useful in
            moderation. A good servant but a bad monster. And all so-called civilized
            peoples have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive because, through
            excessive thinking they have lost touch with reality. That’s to say, we 
            confuse signs, words, numbers, symbols and ideas with the real world.”
  
    
            “The reason you want to be better is the reason why you aren’t, shall I 
            put it like that? We aren’t better because we want to be. Because the road 
            to hell is paved with good intentions. Because all the do-gooders in the world
            whether they’re doing good for others or doing it for themselves are 
            troublemakers: on the basis of “kindly let me help you or you will drown,” 
            said the monkey putting the fish safely up a tree. Sometimes doing good to 
            others and even doing good to oneself is amazingly destructive because it’s 
            full of conceit. How do you know what’s good for other people? How do you know
            what’s good for you? If you say you want to improve then you ought to know 
            what’s good for you, but obviously you don’t because if you did then you would 
            be improved. So, we don’t know. We do not really know how to interfere with 
            the way the world is.”
  
  
            “Every intelligent individual wants to know what makes him tick, and yet is 
            at once fascinated and frustrated by the fact that oneself is the most 
            difficult of all things to know.”
  
  
            “We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and emotions 
            are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which
            we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society.”
  
  
            “By being responsible, we’ve created civilization, medicine, care of the poor,
            everything, but what a headache the thing has become? As we solve all our 
            problems, we make more problems and every problem you solved gives you ten new
            problems. I’m not saying don’t do that, but don’t think you’re going to get 
            anywhere by doing that. That’s one way of arranging it, that’s one kind of 
            dance you can have, is to improve everything and have technology, but it doesn’t
            really solve anything. And it’s only in a moment, you see, when you fully 
            understand that your situation as a human being is completely insoluable…that
            there is no answer and that you give up looking for the answer — that’s PHEW — 
            that’s Nirvana and that’s how Buddhism works.”
    
    
            “This is the real secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are 
            doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.”

            “I want to be able to have all these words at my disposal, in my vocabulary, 
            at all time, whenever I need to pull them out.”
  
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>—Steve Jobs</summary>
  
            “Great people self-manage. Once they know what to do, they will go figure 
            how to do it, they don't need to be managed. What they need is a common vision.
            And that's what leadership is. What leadership is, is having a vision, being 
            able to articulate that so people around you can understand it and getting 
            consensus on a common vision. We want great people, but not seasoned 
            professionals. We want the people who's at the tips of their fingers and in 
            their passion the latest understanding of where the technology was and what we 
            could do with that technology and who want to bring that to lots of people. 
            Best managers are great individual contributors who never ever want to be a 
            manager but decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be 
            able to do as good a job as them.”
